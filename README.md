# The Code Accompanying my Course: Data Analysis with Python and pandas

This is all of the course material for my course covering pandas and data analysis with python. I wanted to open source the code to the community so that others can learn.

I would recommend navigating any code you may want to view from [the nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/anabranch/data_analysis_with_python_and_pandas/tree/master/) as looking at IPython Notebooks online is nearly impossible without the NBViewer.

Please let me know if any errors you may notice and please feel free to share the repository with others.

Best,
Bill
